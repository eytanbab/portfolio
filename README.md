# üé≠ My Parody Portfolio

Welcome to my **Parody Portfolio**! This project is a playful take on the typical developer portfolio. It intentionally embraces the most common design patterns and styles seen across countless portfolios to poke fun at the lack of originality in some of the industry‚Äôs standard practices.

## üöÄ Overview

This portfolio is designed to mimic the classic, widely-used styles of developer portfolios. It‚Äôs a parody that highlights how many portfolios tend to look the same while showcasing my skills and projects with a touch of humor.

### Key Features:

- **Classic Layout:** Embracing the traditional layout seen in numerous portfolios.
- **Standard Aesthetics:** Featuring common design elements and patterns.
- **Playful Tone:** A lighthearted commentary on the lack of diversity in portfolio designs.
